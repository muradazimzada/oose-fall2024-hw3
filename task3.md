# Task 3: Assess a Design for InnovateNow

### Overview
InnovateNow is a platform where users post novel ideas, gather feedback through polls, and analyze demographic data. Below is an assessment of the provided design based on the given requirements.

---

## 1. Does the design meet the software specification?

**Partially**, the design covers key concepts such as ideas, polls, and users. However, it lacks clarity on how the collection of demographic data occurs through polls. Thereâ€™s no clear mechanism showing how this data is linked to user feedback.

---

## 2. Cohesion and Coupling

- **Low Coupling**: The design shows good separation between key entities (Idea, Poll, User), promoting low coupling. Changes to the poll structure, for instance, wouldn't heavily impact other areas.

- **High Cohesion**: The responsibilities of each class seem focused. However, the **Demographics** class appears loosely defined and may benefit from being integrated with either the **Poll** or **User** classes to better collect and analyze data.

---

### Suggested Changes
- **Add a clear link between Poll and Demographics**: Integrating Demographics into the Poll class can help capture demographic data as part of user responses, making the design more cohesive and functional.
